# Module 2 Assignment

This was a super tricky assignment that I'm grateful for the support and resources that the bootcamp taught us to use. I met up with a study group to start thinking through the logic in which I shared some skeleton code that a tutoring session taught me. The steps of the code was extremely helpful in planning out the processes. Leveraging notes, Google, and an Excel book that I purchased, I was able to create the code. There was a bug and some syntax errors in which I used Chatgpt and the BCS learning assistant to help cross the finish line.
